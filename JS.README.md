# React Redux Persist

## TS README

- [TS README](./README.md)

## Description

This is a library that helps you to persist your redux store and rehydrate it when the app is reloaded.
It uses the local storage, session storage or cookies to store the data.
Project is written in TypeScript. However, you can use it in JavaScript projects as well.

## Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm install react-redux-persist
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add react-redux-persist
```

## Usage

### @Reduxjs/toolkit

```typescript
import { configureStore, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

import { persistReducer, persistStore } from "react-redux-persist";

// Example of a reducer
const exampleSlice = createSlice({
	name: "example",
	initialState: {
		value: 0,
	},
	reducers: {
		increment: (state) => {
			state.value += 1;
		},
	},
});

// Here you will pass all your reducers
const reducers = {
	example: exampleSlice.reducer,
};

// Create a configuration for the persist
const configs = {
	key: "root", // Key to store the data
	storage: {
		type: "localStorage", // Type of storage (local, session or cookies)
	},
};

const persistReducers = persistReducer(configs, reducers);

const store = configureStore({
	reducer: persistReducers.combinedReducers,
	preloadedState: persistReducers.preloadedState,
});

const persistor = persistStore(store, configs);

export default persistor;
```

or you can use

### Redux LEGACY

```typescript
import { legacy_createStore as createStore } from "redux";

import { persistReducer, persistStore } from "react-redux-persist";

// Example of a reducer
const initialState = {
	value: 0,
};

const exampleReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
	switch (action.type) {
		case "INCREMENT":
			return {
				...state,
				value: state.value + 1,
			};
		default:
			return state;
	}
};

// Create a configuration for the persist
const configs = {
	key: "root", // Key to store the data
	storage: {
		type: "localStorage", // Type of storage (local, session or cookies)
	},
};

// Here you will pass all your reducers
const reducers = {
	example: exampleReducer,
};

const persistReducers = persistReducer(configs, reducers);

const store = createStore(
	persistReducers.combinedReducers,
	persistReducers.preloadedState,
);

const persistor = persistStore(store, configs);

export default persistor;
```

## How to integrate with React

```tsx
import React from "react";

import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";

import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./redux/store"; // Is the persistor that you created and exported in the previous step

function App() {
	return (
		<Provider store={store}>
			<Router>{/* Your components */}</Router>
		</Provider>
	);
}
```
